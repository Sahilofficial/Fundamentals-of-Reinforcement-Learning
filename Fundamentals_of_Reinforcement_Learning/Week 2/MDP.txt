Create an MDP. Remember to describe the states, actions and rewards. Make sure your three MDPs are different from each other.

 Let's think of a Mario in a grid world, where each grid's cell in either fire, empty or a princess. The states are defined as grid cell which could be fire, nothing or princess. Mario must take action like move up, move down, move left, move right to reach the goal state i.e reach the cell with the princess. The rewards are -5 for reaching the fire and the episode ends, while it is 0 for empty cell and +10 for reaching the princess and again here the episode ends.
